This Python program serves as a management system for the World Rally Cross Championship, allowing users to manage driver details, simulate races, view standings, and save/load data from text files.

Features:

Add Driver Details: Users can add new driver details including name, age, team, car model, and current points to the system.

Delete Driver Details: Enables users to delete driver details based on the entered driver's name.

Update Driver Details: Users can update existing driver details such as name, age, team, car model, and current points.

View Championship Standing Table: Displays a table showing the current standings of drivers based on points accumulated.

Simulate Random Race: Simulates a random race among available drivers, assigns points based on race positions, and displays the leaderboard.

View Race Details: Allows users to view details of past races sorted by date.

Save to File: Enables users to save current driver and race details to text files for later retrieval.

Load from File: Allows users to load previously saved driver and race details from text files.

Usage:

Upon running the program, users are presented with a menu where they can choose various options by typing the corresponding codes. These options include adding, deleting, updating driver details, simulating races, viewing standings, saving to file, loading from file, and exiting the program.

How to Run:

Ensure Python is installed on your system. Open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the Python script, and execute the script by typing python filename.py.

Note: This system assumes that all driver details are accurately entered by users and provides basic error handling for incorrect inputs. It also relies on the presence of two text files (DRIVER_DETAIL_FILE.txt and RACE_DETAIL_FILE.txt) for saving and loading data.
